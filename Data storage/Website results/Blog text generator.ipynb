The CMU index also provides a summary of how much electricity generation is from coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables. According to the Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index, U.S. power plant emissions averaged 1,035 lb CO2 per MWh in the third quarter of 2017, which was down 5 percent from the same time frame in 2016. Continuing the trend seen in Q2 2017 and the first three quarters of 2016, more electricity was generated from natural gas than from coal. Electricity generation from renewables was 10% higher in the third quarter of 2017 when compared to the third quarter of 2016."
