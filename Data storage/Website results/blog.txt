The Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index provides a comprehensive picture of the carbon intensity of electricity production in the during the previous 12 months and over an extended period to 2001. The CMU index also provides a summary of how much electricity generation is from coal, natural gas, nuclear, and renewables. According to the Carnegie Mellon Power Sector Carbon Index, U.S. power plant emissions averaged 952 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was down 4 percent from the same time frame in 2016.

The Power Sector Carbon Index for Q4 of 2017 was 28% lower than in the annual value in 2005, from 1,321 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh to 952 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh (or 599 to 432 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh). As of Q4 of 2017, the rolling annual average carbon intensity was 995 lb CO<sub>2</sub> per MWh (or 451 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh), which is 25% lower than the annual value in 2005.
